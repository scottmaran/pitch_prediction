pcount_at_bat = balls + strikes + fouls

Features:
    Game context:
        - time/date/year (start_tfs_zulu, date, year)
        - score of game (home_team_runs - away_team_runs)
        - who's on base (on_1b, on_2b, on_3b)
        - inning, top of inning (inning, top)
        - balls/strikes/fouls/outs
    Pitcher/Batter context:
        - pitcher handedness (p_throws)
        - pcount_pitcher (total num pitches thrown by pitcher)
        - batter stance (stand)
        - batter height (b_height)
        - at_bat_num (THINK where in batting order)
    Past Pitcher tendencies:

    - how good the batter is (past batting average)
    - Do we need pitcher ID if we have as feature all pitch type history rates?
        Actually maybe? For tree model, easier to split based on id than one of pitch type 

Target: (https://www.daktronics.com/en-us/support/kb/DD3312647)
    Fastballs: - defined by speed 
        'FA', Fastball
        'FF', Four-Seam Fastball    - Carry (straight)
        'FT', Two-Seam Fastball     - Run 
        'SI', Sinker                - Drop 

        'FC', Fastball (cutter)     - Horizontal, opposite direction of two-seamer 
            - for RHP, right to left (like volleyball cut shot)

        'FS', Split-Fingered        - looks like fastball till drops
    Others: - defined by movement 
        'SL', Slider                - sideways, same direction as cutter, more sweeping (i.e. see break happening from beginning to end)
        'CU', Curveball             - up and down 
        'CH', Changeup              - look like fastball but are slower (gets batter to swing too early), can have some fade (move right with righties)
        'KC', Knuckle-Curve
        'KN', Knucleball 
        'EP', Eephus                - rare, "slowball"
    Other: 
        'UN', Unidentified
        'PO', Pitch out 
        'FO', Forkball
        'SC', Screwball

        'IN', Intentional Ball
        'AB', Automatic Ball

Models:
    - Seq-to-Seq model: given sequence of pitch with context
    - Tree model: given player's prior stats and current context, predict pitch type
    
    
    - If have tabular data (e.g. classification types), maybe tree model
    -

Results:
    - one big tree          -> 46.2%
    - individual XGBoosts   -> 42.6%

To do: 
- Get baseline tendencies
- Get xgboost models up 
- Get transformers going
