Target preprocessing:
- Remove FA, bc not sure if FF or FT (and only 204 samples)
- Decision: FT (two seamer) and SI (sinker) usually grouped together. Same speed as FF (four-seamer fastball), but:
    FT: more horizontal movement, "tailing"
    SI: more vertical drop
    - May have enough data where we'll keep separate
    - Fangraphs example groups together (https://community.fangraphs.com/no-pitch-is-an-island-pitch-prediction-with-sequence-to-sequence-deep-learning/)
